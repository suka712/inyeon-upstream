Respond with a JSON object in this EXACT format:
{{
    "summary": "1-2 sentence overview of what changed functionally",
    "impact": "low|medium|high",
    "categories": ["feat", "fix", "refactor", "security", "perf", "docs", "test", "chore"],
    "breaking_changes": ["list of breaking changes, or empty array"],
    "security_concerns": ["list of security observations, or empty array"],
    "files_changed": [
        {{
            "path": "path/to/file",

            "summary": "what changed in this file"
        }}

}}

Guidelines:
- impact: low=typos/docs/formatting, medium=logic/features, high=security/breaking/architecture
- Focus on WHAT changed functionally, not line-by-line syntax
- Be concise but specific
- Only include relevant categories (usually 1-2)
- Respond with valid JSON only, no markdown or explanation"""
